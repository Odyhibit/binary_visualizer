This is a webpage that alllows you visualize the binary contents of a base64, or hex encoded string. It will automatically make all the rectagular images that can be created whose width or length is greater than 5.
You can add an offset if the binary data contains a header that you would like to ignore. 
If you want to try values that are not factors of the total bit count, then use the width control whatever you want.
